3. Ensure the application meets the base requirements
4. Open Pull Request (PR) against this repo

## Overview

In this homework assignment, you will be tasked with completing the functionality of a Rock, Paper, Scissors game.

## Instructions

  * Review the gif below to understand how the app is expected to work

  * Plan out your approach **before** coding (using pseudocode, white boarding, etc.)

  * Use `console.log()` to print out values to console to help ensure you're on the right path

## Requirements

  * The application should work as depicted in the gif image below

    * The score should accurately reflect the result of the game based on the user's choice and the bot's choice

    * The messages depicted in the gif below should also be replicated in your applications

  * Ensure your code adheres to the DRY principle (Don't Repeat Yourself)

  * Code must be properly indented

  * Use jQuery for any DOM manipulation

  * In the finished version of the application, the bot choice should be **random**

## Bonus Requirements (Optional)

**Note**: All of following requirements are optional. You have complete control over how you choose to implement the bonus requirements below. Take this as an opportunity to be creative.

* **Bonus Requirement #1**: Add logic that declares the first person or bot to achieve a score of 10 as the winner of that **round**

  * There should be some visual indication or message that identifies the winner of a **round**


* **Bonus Requirement #2**: Add logic that declares the first person or bot to win 2 rounds the winner of the **game**

  * There should be some visual indication or message that identifies the winner of a **game**


* **Bonus Requirement #3**: Add logic that gives the person or bot 2 bonus points for winning 3 **hands** in a row.

  * A message should be displayed whenever a user / bot has earned a bonus

  * For example: In a normal scenario if the user won 3 hands in a row, they would have 3 points

  * After implementing this bonus requirement, the user / bot would receive an additional 2 points as a reward for winning 3 hands in a row:

  * See the hypothetical scenario below:

  | Hand  | User Choice | Bot Choice | Winner | Score |
  |:-----|:-----|:-----|:-----|:---|
  | #1 | rock | paper| bot | user: 0, bot: 1 |
  | #2 | scissors | paper| user | user: 1, bot: 1 |
  | #3 | paper | rock| user | user: 2, bot: 1 |
  | #4 | rock | scissors| user | user: 5 (3 + 2 bonus points), bot: 1 |
